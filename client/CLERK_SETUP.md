# Clerk Authentication Setup

## Task 2, 3 & 4 Completion

✅ Clerk package installed (`@clerk/nextjs`)
✅ ClerkProvider added to root layout
✅ **Landing page is now the default route (`/`)**
✅ Dashboard created for authenticated users (`/dashboard`)
✅ **Clerk middleware configured for proper redirects**
✅ **Authentication flow with automatic redirects working**

## Fixed: Sign-in Redirect Issue

Added `middleware.ts` to handle proper authentication routing:
- Authenticated users on homepage are automatically redirected to dashboard
- Protected routes require authentication
- Unauthenticated users trying to access dashboard are redirected to homepage

## Environment Variables Required

Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory with:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key_here
CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key_here

# Clerk URLs (using defaults)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_IN_URL=/sign-in
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_SIGN_UP_URL=/sign-up
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_IN_URL=/dashboard
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_AFTER_SIGN_UP_URL=/dashboard
```

## How to get Clerk Keys

1. Go to [Clerk Dashboard](https://dashboard.clerk.com/)
2. Create a new application or select existing one
3. Go to **API Keys** section
4. Copy the **Publishable Key** and **Secret Key**
5. Add them to your `.env.local` file

## Current Routes

- **`/`** - Landing page (public, redirects authenticated users to dashboard)
- **`/dashboard`** - Protected dashboard for authenticated users

## Authentication Flow

1. **Public User**: Visits `/` → sees landing page → can sign in/up
2. **Sign In/Up**: Modal opens → user authenticates → automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
3. **Authenticated User**: Visits `/` → automatically redirected to `/dashboard`
4. **Sign Out**: From dashboard → redirected back to `/` (landing page)

## Testing

- Run `npm run dev` 
- Visit `http://localhost:3000` - you'll see the landing page
- Click "Get Started" or "Sign In" to test authentication
- **After successful login, you should be automatically redirected to `/dashboard`**
- Test sign out from the dashboard to return to landing page
- Try visiting `/dashboard` without being logged in (should redirect to homepage)

**Note**: The authentication won't work until you add your actual Clerk API keys to `.env.local`
